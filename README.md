# PyMongo Blog and API Example works

Created as a final project in a database course, the purpose of this project is to show
familiarity with the Python language and MongoDB through the use of PyMongo.

This project has two parts. The first is an API with no front-end design. It is meant to
test API calls to view and make alterations to the existing database; this is stored in
the API folder. The second shows a simple blog that shows all posts stored in a MongoDB
database and has options for editing the database through a front-end interface. The
design remains simplistic as functionality was the focus of the project. The second part
is stored in the Blog folder.
